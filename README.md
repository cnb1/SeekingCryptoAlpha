ToDo
- disable button for get price unless it is activly trading
- insert first value array index as value
- make the money maps thread safe [need set function]
- last major feature... the updating of the prices and values

    1) static submitted value is used to calculate P/L for each request
    2) this request then updates the value in portfolio based on p/l so menu amount should update
    3) this then stores the value in the value array then updating the chart
    4) last value in value array should always equal value


- get current value amount (fetch commad from) this also needs a button to fetch prices
- when the program is stopped then the total amount 
- if balance is less than or eqal to zero stop trading
